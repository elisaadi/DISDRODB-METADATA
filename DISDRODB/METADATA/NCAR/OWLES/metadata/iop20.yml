comment:
  This IOP focused on downwind persistence and upwind effects east of Lake
  Erie and band evolution over Lake Ontario. The atmosphere was devoid of any radar
  echoes from Lake Erie, both downwind of Buffalo (KBUF) and along the UWKA track
  (WCR). There were no visible boundary-layer clouds, except over lake Ontario. The
  long-fetch band was well-developed along the southern shore and moved northward
  during the IOP.
