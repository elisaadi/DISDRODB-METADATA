comment:
  A surprise LLAP band was sampled on the east shores of Lake Ontario. The
  expectation from model guidance was that it would make landfall between Fairhaven
  and Oswego but instead the band moved Northward. In summary, this is a good case
  study for LLAP and orographic interests, but the coordination between aircraft and
  DOW measurements was rather poor, MIPS was nor under the band, and we did not have
  an east shore radiosonde north of the band.
