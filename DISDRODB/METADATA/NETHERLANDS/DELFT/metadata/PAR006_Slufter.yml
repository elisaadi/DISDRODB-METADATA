comment:
  Located in the Maasvlakte Rotterdam, The Slufter is a large-scale storage
  site for contaminated sludge in the southwestern part of the Rotterdam Maasvlakte,
  approximately 31 km West of the city center of Rotterdam. Along the ring dike of
  the Slufter, several wind turbines belong to the Windpark Slufterdam are providing
  electricity for the region. The sensor is placed on top of an air quality monitoring
  container belonging to TNO, at a height of approx. 4 meters. The rough climate conditions
  near the coast of the North Sea, with high winds, salt, and sand creates a very
  challenging environment for long-term weather observations. Consequently, data availability
  tends to be lower than at other sites, due to frequent maintenance and technical
  issues.
