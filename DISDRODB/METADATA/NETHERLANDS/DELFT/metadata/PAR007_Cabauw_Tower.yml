title: TU Delft optical disdrometer data PAR007 in the meteorological tower at Cabauw
description: ""
project_name: Ruisdael

history: ""
comment:
  This highly unusual location for a precipitation sensor, at 180 meters in
  the meteorological tower of Cabauw was specifically chosen to study the effect of
  wind, turbulence and shielding on raindrop size distributions, as well as to quantify
  the vertical variability of rain near the surface. Two other disdrometers PAR001_Cabauw
  and PAR002_Cabauw located on the ground, approximately 200 meters away can be used
  as a reference to assess biases and measurement uncertainty.
